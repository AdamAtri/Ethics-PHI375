## Non-Derived vs. Derived
### Non-Derived Moral Principles
- Not derived from a more fundamental moral principle

### Derived Moral Principles 
- Derived from a more fundamental moral principle

A moral principle is derived 

## Two Moral Theories
```
           Divine Command      

non         1. Action is right iff God commands it
derived     2. Action is wrong iff God forbids it

derived     1. Do unto others as you would have them do


            Golden Rule Theory

non
derived     1. Do unto others as you would have them do
```

### Distinguishing Moral Theories
- Moral theories are distinguished in terms of their non-derived (base) moral principles
    - Two distinsc moral theories might agree in every individual case
    - Like the Divine Command Theory and the Golden Rule Theory


### A Moral Dilemma
The only wat to stop ` A ` from killing `m` innocent people is to kill an innocent member of ` A `s family. Do you kill the innocent member of ` A `s family?
#### One Answer:
Yes, if `m` > 1

Answer rests on two assumptions:
- The killing of `m` innocent people is worse than the killing of 1 innocent person if `m` > 1.
- An action is morally permissible iff it is the action that produces the best outcome

This is the consequentialist answer

## Assumptions of a Consequentialist Moral Theory
1. We are able to rank the outcomes of our actions from best to worst
    - Requires a theory of value or theory of what is good
    - Different versions of consequentialism use different theories of value
    - What matters is a theory of intrinsic value
2. The right action is the one that produces the best or highest ranked outcome
    - If one acion produces a better outcome than all others, then it is right in the sense of being morally required
    - if there is a tie for first place, then each action is right in the sense of being morally permissible

An Action is morally permissible iff no other action produces a better outcome
- Having no alternative that produces a better outcome is both a necessary and a sufficient condition for an action to be permissible

## Non-Consequentialist Answer
- The only way to stop `A` from killing `m` innocent people is to kill an innocent member of `A`'s family. OK?

#### Answer:
- Certain actions are just not permissible
##### Two versions:
- Absolutist Theory
    - No, no matter how large `m` is.
    (Absolutist theory works at the micro level, but does not scale)
 - Threshold Theory
    - Maybe, only if `m` > `X`
    - `X` = the threshold beyond which killing an innocent person is justified (> 2)

### Assumptions of Non-Consequentialism
- Non-consequentialist theories reject the following claim:
    - An action is morally permissible iff no other action produces a better outcome
- For non-consequentialists, sometimes an action is wrong even though no other action produces a better outcome and an action that produces a lower rnaked outcome is sometimes morally permissible
- For non-c, having no alternative that produces a better outcome is neither *necessary* nor *sufficient* for an action to be morally permissible
- You may end up not taking any action.

### Types of Non-Consequentialism
- Absolutist: Absolute prohibitions
    - Certain types of action - like killing the innocent - are wrong no matter how much good results
- Threshold: Prohibitions with "escape clauses"
    - Certain types of actions - like killing the innocent - are wrong unless the produce really, really god outcomes
- Bot types will sometimes agree with consequentialism: somethimes the action that produces the best outcome doesn't violate any prohibitions

# John Stuart Mill - Consequentialist Moral Theory
### Utilitarianism
1. A version of consequentialism 
    - Whether an action is right is determined by whether it produces the best outcome
2. Utilitarianism = Greatest Happiness Principle
    - Outcomes are ranked in terms of total net happiness (= happiness - unhappiness)

## What is happiness?
- What makes a person's life a good life for that person?
- Not a moral question - it's a question of self-interest
    - e.g., a good life for Hitler isn't a morally good life
- Different theories of happiness/well-being lead to different version of utilitarianism
    - Different theories of happiness/well-being may rank outcomes differently

## Hedonism
Hedonism says the amount of pleasure a person experiences determines how good (=happy) of a life that person has.

"the ultimate end, with reference to and for the sake of which all other things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that of other people), is an existence exemtp as far as possible from pain, and as rich as possible in enjoyments..."

As a hedonist, Mill regards pleasure - and only pleasure - as having positive intrinsic value.

1. Quantitavtive Hedonism
    - Pleasures differ only in quantity (no intellect / sensation division)
    - A life of intellectual pleasure is the best only because of the circumstantial advantages of those pleasures, only because pursuing them leads to a greater quantity of pleasure

2. Qualitative Hedonism
    - Pleasures differ in both quantity and quality
    - Agrees with quantitative hedonism that the circumstantial advantages of the pleasures of the intellect makes a life devoted to them better than a life devoted to the pleasures of senstaion
    - Goes further in holding that the greater intrinsic quality of the plearues of the intellect also makes a life devoted to them better than a life devoted to the pleasures of sensation
    - Mill is a qualitative hedonist
