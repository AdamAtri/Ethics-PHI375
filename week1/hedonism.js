  'Utility (Utilitarianism), is also known as the Greatest Happiness Principle',
  'actions are right in proportion to the happiness they produce, wrong as they tend to produce the opposite',
  'happiness = pleasure / the absence of pain',
  'Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites',
  'It is quite compatible with the principle <not theory> of utility to recognize the fact that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.',
  'Of two pleasures, if there be one that all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure.',
  'Those capable of appreciating and enjoying both give marked preference to the manner of existence which emplys their higher faculties.',
  'No one would conscent to being lowered to obstensively beastly intelligence in order to derive greater physical pleasure from some action, unless truly desperate and unhappy.',
  'A being whose capacities of enjoyment are low has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied',
  'It is better to be a human being dissatisfied, than a pig satisfied',
  'infirmity of character often makes one elect for the nearer good, though it be the less valuable, no less between two bodily pleasures than between bodily and mental.',
  'Capacity for the nobler feelings is in most natures a very tender plant, easily killed, not only by hostile influences, but by mere want of sustenance.',
  'Those who have gone before you are probably in a better position to inform your judgement.',

module.exports.observations = [
  'Mill definitely believes in classes. p259c2 "A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy...he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence."',
  '"Society" should be expected to stimulate the nobler feelings and exercise the higher capacity of people (p260 c1). Could propaganda that stimulated these nobler feelings be considered utilitarian?',

module.exports.questions = [
  'What are Epicureans?',
  'p260 last paragraph, "the judgement of those qualified by knowledge <expect this means the experiencial kind> of both, or that of the majority, must be admitted as final." has a weird authoritarian ring to it.',
