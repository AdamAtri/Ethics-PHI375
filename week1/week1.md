# ETHICS 

## what is philosophy
The uncommonly persistent effort to think things through
- Concerned with how you justify your position more than what your position is
- Concerned with the logical consequences of you position

## Normative Ethics
The investigation and justification of general ethical or moral principles
- Do the ends justify the means? 
- What is the relationship between doing the right thing and being virtuous?

## Applied Ethics

## Metaethics
The investigation of issues about ethics and morality
- Is there such a thing as right and wrong?
- Is it poossible to know what actions are right and what actions are wrong?




## Moral Theories & Moral Principles 
A moral theory is a collection of moral principles.
Moral priciples give necessary and/or sufficient conditions for right/wrong or good/bad
### Morally Permissible vs. Morally Impermissible
Consider someone -- the agent -- deciding between different options or courses of action.
- a moral theoury classifies the agent's options as either being morally permissible of impermissible
- the distinction is exhaustive: every action is either permissible or it is not.
- wrong = morally impermissible
- right = morally required / the only permissible option available to the agent
- right = morally permissible but not necessarily the only option

### Intrinsic Value vs. Extrinsic Value
- Good/Bad - are used to describe things as having either positive or negative value

Moral philosophy divides value into two categories
- IntrinsicValue = not derived from the value of something else
- Extrinsic Value = derived from the value of something else

### Necessary Condition vs. Sufficient Condition
Saying "X is a necessary condition for Y" is equivalent to saying "Y is a sufficient condition for X"


## Examples
"All wrong actions harm others in some way."
- wrong actions are sufficient to know that someone has been harmed
- someone being harmed is a necessary condition to describe a wrong action
