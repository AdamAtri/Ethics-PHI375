## I. Lying to a murderer


Scrutinized under the lens of Kant's Formula of Universal Law, only those actions derived from maxims which could be willed to become universal laws, principles that one not only should but essentially must abide by, can be considered moral. Maxims suffering from a contradiction of conception, wherein a maxim would become ineffectual in attaining its stated purpose if universalized, or from a contradiction in willing, where one can find exceptions to the universality of a maxim that is objectively necessary, are automatically excluded from any high moral appraisal as they inexorably lead to a violation of one's duties. Any maxim that relies on lying to obtain its end, at least on the face of it, would seem to fail the universal law assessment since, it can be assumed, that a lie is less effective the more universally it is practiced.

Korsgaard is quick to point out that lies are effective precisely because they deceive. In any given context of communication between people, there exists an expected level of honesty, varying from "the truth and nothing but" in the courtroom at the one end, down to the exaggerations, absurdities, and outright lies required for some jokes, at the other. Korsgaard extracts from this the insight that the efficacy of maxims that rely on lying is contextually bound, exposing that the deception inherent in a lie does not interfere with the purpose of a joke, amusement, where it absolutely does interfere with the purpose of say a promise, which is to provide assurance and security. Clearly,  gaining some advantage by making a promise based on a lie only works because it's not widely practiced; the user is obviously making an exception of himself, as there would be no advantage to be gained, and the general concept of a promise itself would be pretty much meaningless, if it was widely practiced. Thus, such a maxim would suffer from both a contradiction of willing as well as a contradiction of conception, and as such is manifestly immoral.

<blockquote>
...infamous serial killer Chainsaw McGraw...shows up at your front door disguised as a police officer. He asks you whether your roommate is home. However, you have seen through his disguise...
</blockquote>

When Chainsaw shows up at the doorstep wearing an officer's uniform it's clear that he is willing to exploit the context of trust and security provided by the expected relationship between a police officer and a citizen. By making an exception of himself, and engaging in deception,  Chainsaw has put himself in an ethically precarious, but assuredly not unfamiliar, position as a deceiver. At this point, Korsgaard would defend a universal practice of lying under these circumstances precisely because lying would "be efficacious... because [Chainsaw] supposes you do not know what circumstances you are in." That is, since he's engaged in deception in a context that expects a high level of honest communication he himself is susceptible to a lie that would thwart his evil intent. Therefore, lying to a deceiver, who does not know that his intended victim sees through the deception, so that his evil intent may be prevented, passes FUL muster.


<blockquote>
Unfortunately, you do not have a good poker face. You realize that Chainsaw knows that you have recognized him.
</blockquote>

Blast it! 

So, now Chainsaw knows, or minimally suspects, that I know that he's a liar. Korsgaard says that we can't spoil "our own purposes by publishing our maxims," and even if Chainsaw is aware that his deception has failed, if I announce that I "will say whatever is necessary in order to conceal the truth," then I can continue to lie intermittently, making myself an unreliable source of information. Chainsaw is going to have to find my roommate through some other means. That is, it is morally permissible to lie to a deceiver who is aware that his deception no longer holds, if I have announced my own intent to be an unreliable source of information, to thwart his evil intent. The expectation of high-level honesty is obliterated in this context, just as it is when telling a joke. Which may, dubiously, be taken one step further to say that it is morally permissible to lie if one wants to be perceived as an unreliable source of information, provided that one has emphatically announced the intent to be such.



## II. Are Timers Immoral?
Given the discussion so far, the moral permissibility of lights on timers, providing a false indication of home occupancy, intended to ward off potential thieves, hinges on the somewhat dubious Unreliable Source maxim above. If that holds, then it's clearly permissible.

Can I will it to be universal law that anyone should be allowed to lie in an attempt to become an unreliable source of information, provided that anyone who wanted to be perceived as such clearly announced their intent to be so? Does this reduce all communication with such a person to the expectation of an honesty-level similar to that of a joke? I think, if such a person announced his intent to each and every individual he communicated with, each and every time they engaged in any level of communication, the moral argument could be made for its permissibility. To a certain extent you could say that comedians, as a profession, do in fact do this, as do television shows like _The Daily Show_, and it is not immoral for them to do so because everyone is aware of the truth quotient at all times. 

The specific case of lights in a home on timers needs its own example. Let's say that one of Chainsaw's victims, a critically wounded fellow, escapes before Chainsaw delivers the cout de gras. Desperately in need of help, Lucky Larry is faced with a dilemma about where seek it. To the left is one house with its lights on, to the right is another, although what Larry doesn't know is that the house on left has loving and healthy family milling about inside, doing family oriented things, perfectly willing and charitable enough to help in his time of need, while the one on the right is completely empty and has been for several days, the lights being on timers. Well it turns out that Larry's luck has run its course. Larry chooses the house on the right, and once he's realized his mistake it's too late. He bleeds out before he can turn around and get to the Rockwell's. I think Korsgaard would say that the owner of the house with the timer lights carries at least a degree of culpability in Larry's demise, holding that the lights constitute some sort of deceit in the absence of an exclamation of intent to be an Unreliable Source.  Korsgaard straight says that if the murderer at your door is honest about his intent from the start, its morally indefensible to just lie to him, the "only recourse is refusal to answer." Perhaps if the home owner put a sign at the end of his driveway, and another one on his front door that read, "Lights might be on timers! Maybe we're home, or maybe we're not" in print large enough to read at some distance, that would be sufficient to meet the more stringent requirements of a general Unreliable Source maxim. But what if Lucky Larry can't read?
