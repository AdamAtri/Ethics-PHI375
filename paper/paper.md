## I. Lying to a murderer

While Kant's overall "rigorism", as Korsgaard calls it, sets an almost impossibly high bar for moral and ethical conduct, going so far as to state emphatically that one "might justly be accused as the cause of ... death" if lying to a murderer even coincidentally leads to a murder, _The Right to Lie_ makes a convincing case that, yes, it is morally permissable to lie to the murderer. Synthesizing Kant's Formula of Universal Law (FUL), and the Formulas of Humanity and the Kingdom of Ends (FOH), Korsgaard yields a double-level theory that defines both an "ideal of conduct to live up to" as well as a "sphere of responsibility for everyday life" that is capable of coping with the ethical concerns that arise when dealing with the special case of evil. Her attempt seems to be, less in conflict than one might think, and very much more in keeping with the original spirit of the Kantian ethic.






Imagine that several months ago your roommate provided crucial testimony at the trial of the infamous serial killer Chainsaw McGraw. Unfortunately, Chainsaw has escaped. One day, while your roommate is taking a nap on the couch, Chainsaw shows up at your front door disguised as a police officer. He asks you whether your roommate is home. However, you have seen through his disguise and, therefore, know that the person at the door is not a police officer but a vicious murderer seeking to kill your roommate. 

  <blockquote>
  morality itself sometimes allows or even requires us to do something that from an ideal perspective is wrong.
  <br>
  special principles for dealing with evil.
  </blockquote>



Unfortunately, you do not have a good poker face. You realize that Chainsaw knows that you have recognized him. According to Korsgaard’s interpretation of the FUL, is it morally permissible to lie to Chainsaw about where your roommate is? 



## II. Are Timers Immoral?


Say Chainsaw is recaptured. With him safely back behind bars, you and your roommate decide to leave on vacation. You decide to use timers to turn the lights of your apartment on and off so that potential thieves will falsely believe that your apartment is occupied and not attempt to break in. According to Korsgaard’s interpretation of the FUL, is it morally permissible for you to do so?
