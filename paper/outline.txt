The "Rigorism" of Kantian Ethics - the law remains in full force because it commands categorically.
- explain "commands categorically"


The duty to tell the truth: (perfect duty?)
- 1) one must never under any circumstance or for any purpose tell a lie.
- 2) one who does lie is responsible for all consequences of the lie even if those
    consequences are unintended and unforeseeable.

  lying violates the perfect duty to oneself. "...the consequences of which will be
  imputed on him by his conscience."
    ?? is one's conscience the final arbiter of right and wrong?

  Kant goes on to indicate that the liar must also be held legally responsible for
  coincidental harms that may have emanated from the lie.

  Under the FUL, can a lie that is intended to prevent a murder be permissible?
  According to FH not lying to each other is "an attractive ideal of human relations
    which is the basis of [Kant's] ethical system."
     - If Kant is wrong about lying to the murderer, it is for the interesting and
       important reason that morality sometimes allows or even requires us to do something
       that from a moral perspective appears wrong.
  Are there special principles that can deal with evil, within Kant's framework?
