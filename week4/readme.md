# Act Utilitarianism

AU onlu requires that the action maximize utility not that the agent's motives 

## Mill's Answer to the Second Problem
"Whatever we adopt as the fundamental principle of morality, we require subordinate primciples to apply it by (421)."

- The fundamental principle of marlity explains what makes actions right or wrong
  - For AU, the fundamental principle is that the right action is whatever maximizes net utility
  - It's the criterion of right and wrong
  - No guarantee it won't be impractical or impossible to apply in particular cases

- The subordinate (or secondary) principles provide practical procedures for deciding whether a particular action is right or wrong.
  - They can be easily applied to a situation
  - But they are only rules of thumb which can lead you astray even if correctly applied

## Example Case
### Deciding Whether to Save a Drownin Child
Two ways of making a decision:

1. Use the fundamental principle of AU and attempt to calculate which option in this particular case maximizes net utility
 - 20% of the time doing so leads to you doing the utilty maximizing action
 - 80% of the time doing so leads to you failing to do the utility maximizing action beacuse you don't have time to apply it or you apply it incorrectly

 2. Use the subordinate principle "Always save drowning children".
  - 98 % of the time doing so leads to you doing the utiltity maximizing action because saving drowning children almost always maximizes overall net utility

- Utilitarians endorse using the subordinate principle when making a decision because doing so has a higher rate of success than using the fundamental principle
- But the subordinate pirnciple is NOT the criterion of right and wrong


Imagine it is better to let a certain child drown:
1. Jane uses "Always save drowning children" as her decision procedure and saves the child
2. Jack tries to calculate whether saving the child will maximize happiness and, while he is doing so, the child drowns
